#Here i am working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9!
#A reduced version of the MNIST dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one i will use.
#Each sample in this scikit-learn dataset is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit.
#Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating varying levels of black.
#For MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an 'images' key in addition to the 'data' and 'target' keys. Because it is a 2D array of the images
#corresponding to each sample, this 'images' key is useful for visualizing the images. On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array
#the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels. I have used the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm
